# Getting Started with Nexmo Voice APIs with Node.js

## Set up the ENV with Your Nexmo API Keys

To use this sample you will first need a [Nexmo account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up). Once you have your own API credentials, rename
the `.env-example` file to `.env` and set the values as required.

You also need to [buy a number](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/buy-numbers) where you can send and receive SMS messages.

## Run the Examples

To run Voice APIs, you need to set up your secure Nexmo Application first. You can use [Nexmo CLI tool](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli) to create and manage your Nexmo Applications.
