# Getting Started with Nexmo SMS APIs with Node.js

## Set up the ENV with Your Nexmo API Keys

To use this sample you will first need a [Nexmo account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up). Once you have your own API credentials, rename
the `.env-example` file to `.env` and set the values as required.

You also need to [buy a number](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/buy-numbers) where you can send and receive SMS messages.

## Run the Examples

Run a node script from terminal:

```bash
$ node you_dir/send.js
```

To run "send" examples, just set up your ENV and run locally.

To run "receive" examples, you need to run the webhook file on a server, or tunnel from your local server using the services like [ngrok](http://ngrok.io). See the tutorials for more details.
