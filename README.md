<img src="https://developer.nexmo.com/images/logos/vbc-logo.svg" height="48px"/>

Quickstarts also available for:
[Python](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-python-code-snippets),
[.NET](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-dotnet-code-snippets),
[Node.js](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-node-code-snippets),
[PHP](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-php-code-snippets),
[Ruby](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-ruby-code-snippets) and
[cURL](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-curl-code-snippets).

These code samples are meant to be used for
[https://developer.nexmo.com/](https://developer.nexmo.com/), and are
structured in such a way as to be used for internal testing. Developers are
free to use these code snippets as a reference, but these may require changes
to be worked into your specific application. We recommend checking out the
[Vonage API Developer Website](https://developer.nexmo.com/), which displays
these code snippets in a more copy/paste fashion.

## Configure with Your Vonage API Keys

If you'd still like to use this sample you will first need a
[Vonage account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up). Once you have your own
API credentials, rename the `.env-example` file to `.env` and set the values
as required.

For some of the examples, you will need to
[buy a number](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/buy-numbers).
