# Nexmo APIs Quickstart Examples for Node.JS


Quickstarts also available for: [Java](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-java-quickstart), [.NET](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-dotnet-quickstart), [PHP](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-php-quickstart), [Python](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-python-quickstart), [Ruby](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-ruby-quickstart)

The purpose of the quickstart guide is to provide simple examples focused on one goal. For example, sending an SMS, handling an incoming SMS webhook or making a Text to Speech call.

## Configure with Your Nexmo API Keys

To use this sample you will first need a [Nexmo account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up). Once you have your own API credentials, rename
the `.env-example` file to `.env` and set the values as required.

For some of the examples, you will need to [buy a number](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/buy-numbers).
